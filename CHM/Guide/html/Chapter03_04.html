			<h1>Alternative Operating Systems</h1>
		</div>
		<div id="content">

<p>In a world where most end users only know about or are familiar with
Microsoft Windows, it's easy to forget that there are alternative
operating systems out there, right? For those of you who aren't using
Windows, it's still possible to run µTorrent in your operating system,
it just takes a bit more fussing around to get it running more nicely
(though there might still be residual problems in functionality due to
operating system limitations).</p>

<h3><a class="name" id="Running_on_Wine" href="#Running_on_Wine">Running on Wine (*BSD, GNU/Linux)</a></h3>
<p>Wine is an open source project that aims to implement the Windows
API on Unix-like operating systems. In simpler terms, it is an attempt
to allow users running a Unix-like operating system (such as *BSD or
GNU/Linux) to execute applications that normally run only on Windows.
The first step in running µTorrent on Wine would, naturally, be to
download and install the latest version of Wine from <a href="ExternalLinks.html#Running_on_Alternative_Operating_Systems">WineHQ.org</a> if you haven't already done so.</p>
<p>When Wine is installed, the only thing you need to do is run µTorrent by using the <span class="value">wine</span>
command in a terminal window. Wherever you have your µTorrent
executable located at on your filesystem, you simply run µTorrent with
the command <span class="value">wine FULL_PATH</span> (where <span class="value">FULL_PATH</span>
is the full path to the µTorrent executable) in in the terminal window.
Naturally, there are many different (and easier) ways to execute
µTorrent through Wine, but because there are infinitely many
combinations of softwares available for use on the Unix-like operating
systems, the most generic way will have to suffice.</p>
<p>So where exactly is the hard part in using µTorrent on Wine? It's in
the limitations that come with using Wine and its incomplete
implementation of the Windows API. Because of this, and the fact that
Wine is unable to integrate too deeply with its host operating system,
there are several known issues you should be aware of:</p>
<ul class="uienum">
	<li><a class="name" id="Running_on_Wine.Problem_workarounds" href="#Running_on_Wine.Problem_workarounds">Problem workarounds</a>: Some known issues with Wine have been worked around in µTorrent with a set of "hacks" enabled through <a href="AppendixA_02_12.html#sys.enable_wine_hacks">sys.enable_wine_hacks</a>.</li>
	<li><a class="name" id="Running_on_Wine.Boss-Key" href="#Running_on_Wine.Boss-Key">Boss-Key</a>: <a href="AppendixA_02_01.html#Privacy.Boss-Key">Boss-keys</a> do not work under Wine.</li>
	<li><a class="name" id="Running_on_Wine.Graphical_oddities" href="#Running_on_Wine.Graphical_oddities">Graphical oddities</a>: There are several oddities in the interface running µTorrent under Wine...
		<ul class="sublist">
			<li>By
default, the interface sticks out like a sore thumb, with the gray
Windows application window background in all its glory. Users can
modify the theme colors in the "<em>Desktop Integration</em>" tab of <span class="value">winecfg</span> to better integrate Wine-run applications with surrounding applications.</li>
			<li>If the list-view has a black background, then make sure the Windows version is set to Windows XP in <span class="value">winecfg</span>.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><a class="name" id="Running_on_Wine.Open_Containing_Folder_Open_File" href="#Running_on_Wine.Open_Containing_Folder_Open_File">Open Containing Folder</a>: Because <a href="AppendixA_01_04.html#Context_Menu.Torrent_Options.Open_Containing_Folder">Open Containing Folder</a>
attempts to open a Windows Explorer process, and the native Windows
Explorer is not present on alternative operating systems, it will open
the Wine implementation, which looks unimpressive, and does not work
very well. Unless you can tolerate it, don't bother using this feature
under Wine.</li>
	<li><a class="name" id="Running_on_Wine.Open_File" href="#Running_on_Wine.Open_File">Open File</a>: "<em>Open</em>" in <a href="AppendixA_01_04.html#Context_Menu.Torrent_Options.Open">the torrent jobs list context menu</a> or on <a href="AppendixA_01_05_05.html#Context_Menu.Open">the Files tab</a> will not work, as they attempt to run a Windows application associated with the file type, but since there are none, they fail.</li>
	<li><a class="name" id="Running_on_Wine.Settings_directory" href="#Running_on_Wine.Settings_directory">Settings directory</a>: Because Windows environment variables do not apply in alternative operating systems, it naturally follows that <span class="value">%AppData%</span> does not either. You'll find that the <a href="AppendixB_01.html">µTorrent settings directory</a> is actually located at <span class="value">~/.wine/drive_c/windows/profiles/USERNAME/Application Data/uTorrent</span>, where <span class="value">USERNAME</span> is your username on the operating system.</li>
	<li><a class="name" id="Running_on_Wine.Start_on_system_startup" href="#Running_on_Wine.Start_on_system_startup">Start on system startup</a>:
Because alternative operating systems have different methods of booting
applications at startup, the usual methods of adding a startup entry in
Windows (be it in the Registry, or in the Start menu) won't work. <a href="AppendixA_02_01.html#Windows_Integration.Start_uTorrent_on_system_startup">Start µTorrent on system startup</a> should be disabled.</li>
	<li><a class="name" id="Running_on_Wine.System_tray" href="#Running_on_Wine.System_tray">System tray</a>: The <a href="AppendixA_02_02.html#System_Tray">system tray feature</a> has been reported to be flaky under Wine, so if you have issues using it, you should disable all relevant options.</li>
	<li><a class="name" id="Running_on_Wine.torrent_file_association" href="#Running_on_Wine.torrent_file_association">.torrent file association</a>: Due to the inability of Wine to map file associations to applications run through Wine, the feature is rendered useless. <a href="AppendixA_02_01.html#Windows_Integration.Check_association_on_startup">Check association on startup</a> should be disabled. An alternative method of "emulating" file association would be to use the <a href="AppendixA_02_03.html#Location_of_.torrents.Automatically_load_.torrents_in_directory">auto-load torrents</a>
feature to tell µTorrent to automatically load files from a directory
on your filesystem. In that way, you can simply drag or download
.torrent files into that directory, and if µTorrent is running, it will
automatically load the new files.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a class="name" id="Running_on_Darwine" href="#Running_on_Darwine">Running on Darwine (Mac OS X)</a></h3>
<p>Note: There is a native &micro;Torrent client for Mac available <a href="http://www.utorrent.com/downloads/mac">here</a>. If you have an older version of Mac OS X (10.4 or below) you may need to use the instructions below. </p><p><a href="ExternalLinks.html#Running_on_Alternative_Operating_Systems">Darwine</a>
is a port of Wine for use on Darwin and Darwin-based operating systems,
such as Apple's Mac OS X. Darwine requires an X server to work, so if
you don't already have it installed, you can find the installer in the
Apple Restore DVD, or by downloading it along with Apple's <a href="ExternalLinks.html#Running_on_Alternative_Operating_Systems">XCode</a>.</p>
<p>Installing Darwine should be a cinch. Just as with Wine, it's
generally best to download and install the latest version of Darwine.
After installed, you should be able to simply double-click µTorrent's
executable file, and Darwine should automatically run the application.
If not, then run <span class="value">WineHelper.app</span> (which should be located in the installed Darwine directory) then open µTorrent's executable file. That's all!</p>
<p>Not unlike Wine, there are several known issues in using µTorrent with Darwine that you should be aware of:</p>
<ul class="uienum">
	<li><a class="name" id="Running_on_Darwine.Shared_bugs" href="#Running_on_Darwine.Shared_bugs">Shared bugs</a>: Due to its heritage, Darwine exhibits <a href="#Running_on_Wine">all of the same issues that Wine does</a>.</li>
	<li><a class="name" id="Running_on_Darwine.Drag-and-drop" href="#Running_on_Darwine.Drag-and-drop">Drag-and-drop</a>: Drag-and-drop doesn't work under Darwine.</li>
	<li><a class="name" id="Running_on_Darwine.Secondary-click" href="#Running_on_Darwine.Secondary-click">Secondary-click</a>: <span class="key">Option</span>+<span class="mouse">left-click</span> doesn't send a <span class="mouse">secondary-click</span> event to µTorrent because it has not been implemented in Wine.</li>
</ul>
