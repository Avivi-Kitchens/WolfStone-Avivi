<ul class="uienum">
	<li>The <a class="name" id="Queue_Settings.Maximum_number_of_active_torrents" href="#Queue_Settings.Maximum_number_of_active_torrents">Maximum number of active torrents</a>
field defines the maximum number of unforced torrent jobs that µTorrent
will allow to be active before placing it on the queue. Torrent jobs
are counted regardless of whether they're seeding or downloading
torrents, as long as they are uploading at rates above the value
specified by <a href="AppendixA_02_12.html#queue.slow_ul_threshold">queue.slow_ul_threshold</a> or downloading at rates above the value specified by <a href="AppendixA_02_12.html#queue.slow_dl_threshold">queue.slow_dl_threshold</a>.</li>
	<li>The <a class="name" id="Queue_Settings.Maximum_number_of_active_downloads" href="#Queue_Settings.Maximum_number_of_active_downloads">Maximum number of active downloads</a>
field defines the maximum number of unforced torrent jobs that µTorrent
will allow to be downloaded before making it wait on the download
queue. This option only applies to torrent jobs that are downloading or
are to be placed in downloading mode.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a class="name" id="Seeding_Goal" href="#Seeding_Goal">Seeding Goal</a></h3>
<ul class="uienum">
	<li>The <a class="name" id="Seeding_Goal.Minimum_ratio" href="#Seeding_Goal.Minimum_ratio">Minimum ratio</a>
field allows you to set the ratio that you wish to reach before
µTorrent throttles the speed for the torrent job (or stops it, if you
set it to do so). Setting the ratio to <span class="value">-1</span> is equivalent to setting it to unlimited. Setting this value to <span class="value">0</span>
tells µTorrent to ignore this value and look only at the seeding time
limit. This value is interpreted as a percentage. µTorrent will
throttle the seeding process only after both this and time limit have
been reached.</li>
	<li>The <a class="name" id="Seeding_Goal.Minimum_seeding_time" href="#Seeding_Goal.Minimum_seeding_time">Minimum seeding time</a>
field allows you to specify the minimum amount of time you wish for the
torrent job to continue seeding at normal speeds after it has finished
downloading. µTorrent will throttle the seeding process only after both
this and the ratio threshold have been reached. This value is
interpreted in minutes.</li>
	<li><a class="name" id="Seeding_Goal.Seeding_tasks_have_higher_priority_than_downloading_tasks" href="#Seeding_Goal.Seeding_tasks_have_higher_priority_than_downloading_tasks">Seeding tasks have higher priority than downloading tasks</a>
will give seeding tasks higher priority than downloads, so if your
maximum number of active torrents is reached, and a torrent job reaches
seeding state, the downloading tasks will not force it into queued
seeding state.</li><li><a class="name" id="Seeding_Goal.Seeding_tasks_have_higher_priority_than_downloading_tasks" href="#Seeding_Goal.Minimum_number_of_available_seeds">Minimum number of available seeds&nbsp;</a> will keep seeding till the specified number of seeds are available for this torrent </li>
	<li><a class="name" id="Seeding_Goal.Note" href="#Seeding_Goal.Note">Note</a>:
These values only affect torrent jobs added after they are set.
Existing torrent jobs will retain their current seeding goals, even if
these default settings are modified.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a class="name" id="When_uTorrent_Reaches_the_Seeding_Goal" href="#When_uTorrent_Reaches_the_Seeding_Goal">When µTorrent Reaches the Seeding Goal</a></h3>
<ul class="uienum">
	<li>The <a class="name" id="When_uTorrent_has_reached_the_seeding_goal.Limit_the_upload_rate_to" href="#When_uTorrent_has_reached_the_seeding_goal.Limit_the_upload_rate_to">Limit the upload rate to</a>
field allows you to set the speed that µTorrent throttles the upload
speed for a torrent job to when it reaches the seeding goal set.
Setting this value to <span class="value">0</span> is equivalent to
telling µTorrent to stop the torrent job. A change to this value
affects only torrent jobs that have not yet reached their seeding
goals. This value is interpreted in KiB/s, so please enter it as such.</li>
