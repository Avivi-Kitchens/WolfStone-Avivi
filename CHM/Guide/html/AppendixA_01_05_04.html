<p><a class="name" id="Remove" href="AppendixA_01_02.html#Remove"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 13px; height: 11px;" class="floatLeft" src="../img/tabs_pieces.png" alt="Remove" /></a>The Pieces tab displays each piece currently being downloaded by µTorrent. If a piece is selected, then holding <span class="key">Shift</span> on the keyboard while <span class="mouse">right-click</span>ing on the pieces list will display a context menu with the option, "<em>Log piece info...</em>." When selected, debug information is added to <a href="AppendixA_01_05_07.html">the Logger tab</a> for the currently-highlighted piece. The following is a description of each column:</p>
<ul class="uienum">
	<li><a class="name" id="Number" href="#Number">#</a> is the piece's number in the .torrent file.</li>
	<li><a class="name" id="Number_of_Blocks" href="#Number_of_Blocks"># of Blocks</a> is the number of <span class="value">16</span> KiB blocks that compose that single piece.</li>
	<li><a class="name" id="Availability" href="#Availability">Availability</a> is the number of times this piece is seen completed within the group of peers you are currently connected to.</li>
	<li><a class="name" id="Blocks" href="#Blocks">Blocks</a>
is the graphical progress bar for the piece. You'll notice that there
are different colors displayed for different blocks. They are as
follows: <ul class="sublist">
			<li><a class="name" id="Blocks.Dark_blue" href="#Blocks.Dark_blue">Dark blue</a> means the data has been downloaded and written to disk.</li>
			<li><a class="name" id="Blocks.Medium_blue" href="#Blocks.Medium_blue">Medium blue</a> means the data has been downloaded, but remains in the cache in memory, unwritten to disk.</li>
			<li><a class="name" id="Blocks.Light_blue" href="#Blocks.Light_blue">Light blue</a> means the data has been requested from a single peer.</li>
			<li><a class="name" id="Blocks.Green" href="#Blocks.Green">Green</a> means the data has been requested from multiple peers. Blocks only turn green during endgame mode.</li>
			<li><a class="name" id="Blocks.White" href="#Blocks.White">White</a> means the data is is available in the swarm, but has not yet been downloaded.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><a class="name" id="Completed" href="#Completed">Completed</a> is the number of blocks completed in the piece.</li>
	<li><a class="name" id="Mode" href="#Mode">Mode</a> is the general evaluation of the speed at which the piece is being transferred by the peer. A piece's mode can be either <span class="value">fast</span>, <span class="value">medium</span>, or <span class="value">slow</span>.
µTorrent uses this evaluation to determine whether a piece should be
taken from fast peers or slow seeds. This is meant to try to prevent
situations where a slow seed sends the same piece as a fast peer.
Instead of allowing that to happen, µTorrent attempts to have the
slower seed send another piece, possibly something that might be rarer
in the swarm.</li>
	<li><a class="name" id="Priority" href="#Priority">Priority</a> shows the priority µTorrent has assigned the piece based on <a href="AppendixA_01_05_05.html#Priority">the priority of the file(s) it belongs to</a>.
If the piece belongs to multiple files, then it is assigned the highest
priority of the files it belongs to. If a piece passes the criteria for
being given higher priority by <a href="AppendixA_02_12.html#bt.prio_first_last_piece">bt.prio_first_last_piece</a>
(assuming the option is enabled), and the piece's priority is not
skipped, then piece's priority is elevated by one priority level.</li>
	<li><a class="name" id="Size" href="#Size">Size</a> is the size of the piece.</li>
</ul>
