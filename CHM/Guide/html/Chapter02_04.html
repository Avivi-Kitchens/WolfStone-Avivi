<h1>Downloading With µTorrent</h1>
</div>

<div id="content">
<p>Similar to needing a URL, like <span
class="value">http://www.utorrent.com</span>, to go to a website and download
content, either a <strong>.torrent file</strong> or a <strong>Magnet
link</strong> is required to download content available through BitTorrent.
Most of the time, you can download this file from a website, though you can
also get it from a friend or some other form of transfer. Many websites offer
.torrent files as one method of downloading files available through that
website. Sites that contain .torrent files are generally repositories of only
the .torrent files, and usually don't create or directly make available any of
the content being shared. These sites are either index sites or trackers. While
<strong>torrent index</strong> sites list .torrent files for download,
<strong>torrent trackers</strong> merely coordinate the swarm. Many torrent
trackers function as a torrent index as well, listing the torrents that it
tracks (and sometimes, torrents from external trackers as well).</p>

<p>So where do you go about looking for these .torrent files? Searching with
your favorite search engine, and attaching the word <em>torrent</em> to the
query generally works wonders in finding you decent results, but µTorrent also
includes <a href="AppendixA_01_02.html#Search">a built-in search bar</a> to
some of the more popular .torrent file search engines.</p>

<h3><a class="name" id="Adding_a_Torrent" href="#Adding_a_Torrent">Adding a
Torrent</a></h3>

<p>Once you obtain the .torrent file you wish to download, you simply import it
into µTorrent. There are several ways of achieving this in µTorrent:</p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="mouse">Double-click</span> the .torrent file or the Magnet
    link (only if .torrent files are <a
    href="AppendixA_02_01.html#Windows_Integration.Associate_with_.torrent_files">associated
    with µTorrent</a>)</li>
  <li><span class="mouse">Drag-and-drop</span> the .torrent file into
  µTorrent</li>
  <li>Select "<em>File</em>" then "<em>Add Torrent</em>" (or press <span
    class="key">Ctrl</span>+<span class="key">O</span>) in µTorrent and open
    the .torrent file</li>
  <li>If you know the direct URL to the .torrent file, but don't have it on
    your hard drive, you can select "<em>File</em>" then "<em>Add Torrent from
    URL</em>" (or press <span class="key">Ctrl</span>+<span
    class="key">U</span>) in µTorrent and enter the URL of the .torrent
  file</li>
</ul>

<p>After opening the .torrent file, tell µTorrent where you'd like the torrent
contents to be saved. If µTorrent doesn't automatically start downloading, you
can start the torrent job manually by selecting the torrent job in the list and
pressing the "<em>Start</em>" button on <a
href="AppendixA_01_02.html#Start">the µTorrent toolbar</a>, or by <span
class="mouse">right-click</span>ing the torrent and selecting "<em>Start</em>".
If you are using a Magnet link, you will need to wait a few seconds for the
Meta-data to be retrieved. </p>

<h3><a class="name" id="What_to_do_After_the_Torrent_Job_Finishes_Downloading"
href="#What_to_do_After_the_Torrent_Job_Finishes_Downloading">What to do After
the Torrent Job Finishes Downloading</a></h3>

<p>After a torrent job finishes downloading, you may view the files that you
have downloaded. While you can also remove the torrent job from the torrent
jobs list if you so wish, you are highly encouraged to leave the torrent job
<strong>seeding</strong> (uploading after you have obtained every piece).
Although the length of time that you should leave the it seeding is not defined
in particular, it is recommended that you share until the amount of data you
upload reaches at least the same as the amount of data that you have download,
also known as reaching a <span class="value">1.0</span> <strong>ratio</strong>.
This ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of data you have uploaded by
the amount that you have downloaded. Granted, it is technically impossible for
every person in any given swarm to reach a <span class="value">1.0</span>
ratio, but people who leave the swarm before even getting close to that ratio
are abhorred in the BitTorrent community, and are labeled as
<strong>leechers</strong> (which carries a strong negative connotation).
Because leechers have a detrimental effect on swarms, some people resort to
vigilante tactics and block connections to leechers. Additionally, private
trackers may ban leechers.</p>
