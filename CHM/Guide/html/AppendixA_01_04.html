		</div>
		<div id="content">

<p>The torrent jobs list is the main interface item in µTorrent. It is
where your torrent jobs are displayed, along with plenty of information
for each of them. Sorting by more than one column is possible in this
list. You can do so by sorting by one column, then hold <span class="key">Shift</span> on your keyboard while selecting the secondary column by which µTorrent should sort the list by. If an RSS item is <span class="mouse">double-click</span>ed, it gets added to the download queue. The following is a description of each column:</p>
<ul class="uienum">
	<li><a class="name" id="Name" href="#Name">Name</a>
displays the name of the torrent job. The initial name used for each
torrent job is the name of the file being transferred (if the torrent
contents consist of a single file), or the directory being transferred
(if the torrent contents consist of multiple files). A torrent job can
be renamed in the list by slow <span class="mouse">double-click</span>ing on the torrent job, or by pressing <span class="key">F2</span> on the keyboard while the torrent job is selected. To cancel the renaming, you should press <span class="key">Esc</span> on the keyboard. To confirm the change, you should press <span class="key">Enter</span>
on the keyboard, or use the mouse to click anywhere else on the torrent
jobs list. Renaming the torrent job will not rename the file or
directory being transferred. <ul class="sublist">
			<li><a class="name" id="Name.status_downloading" href="#Name.status_downloading"><img src="../img/tstatus_downloading.png" alt="Downloading"></a> means the torrent job is downloading without issue</li>
			<li><a class="name" id="Name.status_downloading_queued" href="#Name.status_downloading_queued"><img src="../img/tstatus_downloading_queued.png" alt="Queued Download"></a> means the torrent job is a queued download</li>
			<li><a class="name" id="Name.status_downloading_error" href="#Name.status_downloading_error"><img src="../img/tstatus_downloading_error.png" alt="Downloading (Error)"></a> means the torrent job is downloading, but there is a tracker error</li>
			<li><a class="name" id="Name.status_seeding" href="#Name.status_seeding"><img src="../img/tstatus_seeding.png" alt="Seeding"></a> means the torrent job is seeding without issue</li>
			<li><a class="name" id="Name.status_seeding_queued" href="#Name.status_seeding_queued"><img src="../img/tstatus_seeding_queued.png" alt="Queued Seed"></a> means the torrent job is a queued seed</li>
			<li><a class="name" id="Name.status_seeding_error" href="#Name.status_seeding_error"><img src="../img/tstatus_seeding_error.png" alt="Seeding (Error)"></a> means the torrent job is seeding, but there is a tracker error</li>
			<li><a class="name" id="Name.status_paused" href="#Name.status_paused"><img src="../img/tstatus_paused.png" alt="Paused"></a> means the torrent job is paused</li>
			<li><a class="name" id="Name.status_stopped" href="#Name.status_stopped"><img src="../img/tstatus_stopped.png" alt="Stopped"></a> means the torrent job is stopped, but hasn't finished downloading</li>
			<li><a class="name" id="Name.status_finished" href="#Name.status_finished"><img src="../img/tstatus_finished.png" alt="Finished"></a> means the torrent job is stopped, and has finished downloading</li>
			<li><a class="name" id="Name.status_error" href="#Name.status_error"><img src="../img/tstatus_error.png" alt="Error"></a> means the torrent job has a critical error (check the Status column)</li>
			<li><a class="name" id="Name.rss" href="#Name.rss"><img src="../img/rss.png" alt="RSS"></a> means the item is an RSS feed item that has not been added to the torrent jobs queue</li>
			<li><a class="name" id="Name.rss_new" href="#Name.rss_new"><img src="../img/rss_clock.png" alt="RSS (New)"></a> means the release is less than 24 hours old</li>
			<li><a class="name" id="Name.rss_added" href="#Name.rss_added"><img src="../img/rss_checkmark.png" alt="RSS (Added)"></a> means the torrent job has already been added and moved to the history for the RSS item</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><a class="name" id="Number" href="#Number">#</a>
displays the torrent job's place in the download queue. When a torrent
job stops or finishes, the next lowest numbered torrent job that is
queued for download will start automatically. Torrent jobs that have
not reached <a href="AppendixA_04_04_01.html#Seeding_Goal">the seeding goal</a> will have a <span class="value">*</span>
(asterisk) instead of an integer. Torrent jobs that have reached the
seeding goal will have a blank in this column. Forced torrent jobs do
not follow the queue order, although they will be assigned queue
numbers like regular torrent jobs. Note that if you want the arrow
buttons to move the torrent jobs up and down in the list visually, you
must sort the torrent jobs list by this column.</li>
	<li><a class="name" id="Added_On" href="#Added">Added</a> displays the date and time that the torrent job was added to the torrent jobs list.</li><li><a class="name" id="Availability" href="#Availability">Availability</a> displays the number of copies of the torrent contents that are distributed in the swarm.</li>
	<li><a class="name" id="Bandwidth_Allocation" href="#Bandwidth_Allocation">Bandwidth Allocation</a> displays the bandwidth allocation given to the torrent job (<span class="value">High</span>, <span class="value">Normal</span>, or <span class="value">Low</span>). <span class="mouse">Right-click</span>ing a torrent job on this column will bring up the <a href="#Context_Menu.Torrent_Options.Bandwidth_Allocation">Bandwidth Allocation</a> context sub-menu.</li>
	<li><a class="name" id="Codec" href="#Codec">Codec</a> displays the codec that the video was encoded in assuming it is a video and is an RSS item.</li>
	<li><a class="name" id="Completed" href="#Completed">Completed</a>
displays the total amount of data you have in the torrent contents that
passed the hash checks, as well as any incomplete pieces currently in
progress.</li>
	<li><a class="name" id="Completed_on" href="#Completed_on">Completed On</a>
displays the date and time that the torrent job finished downloading.
If the torrent job has yet to be completed, this column will be blank.</li>
	<li><a class="name" id="Debug" href="#Debug">Debug</a> displays information that might be useful in debugging problems.</li>
		<li><a class="name" id="Disk_Job" href="#Disk_Job">Disk Job</a> displays information on any torrent jobs that are having disk I/O issues.</li>
	<li><a class="name" id="Done" href="#Done">Done</a>
displays the approximate percent of the torrent job that µTorrent has
completed. Its value is calculated by dividing the number under the <a href="#Completed">Completed</a> column by the number under the <a href="#Selected_Size">Selected Size</a> column. If <a href="AppendixA_02_12.html#gui.graphic_progress">gui.graphic_progress</a> is enabled, µTorrent will draw a progress bar behind the percentage. If <a href="AppendixA_02_12.html#gui.piecebar_progress">gui.piecebar_progress</a> is enabled, µTorrent will draw a piece progress bar instead.</li>
	<li><a class="name" id="Down_Limit" href="#Down_Limit">Down Limit</a> displays the maximum download rate limit set on the individual torrent job. If no limit is set, this column will be blank. <span class="mouse">Right-click</span>ing a torrent job on this column will bring up the <a href="#Context_Menu.Torrent_Options.Bandwidth_Allocation.Set_Download_Limit">Set Download Limit</a> context sub-menu.</li>
	<li><a class="name" id="Down_speed" href="#Down_speed">Down Speed</a>
displays the current speed at which data is being downloaded for the
individual torrent job. If the download rate is negligible, this column
will be blank.</li>
	<li><a class="name" id="Downloaded" href="#Downloaded">Downloaded</a> displays the total amount of data you have downloaded, including those that were wasted or failed the hash checks.</li>
	<li><a class="name" id="Elapsed" href="#Elapsed">Elapsed</a> displays the total amount of time that µTorrent has had the torrent job started for since it was added.</li>
	<li><a class="name" id="Episode" href="#Episode">Episode</a> displays the episode number of the torrent job, if applicable.</li>
	<li><a class="name" id="ETA" href="#ETA">ETA</a>
displays the estimated amount of time needed for µTorrent to finish
downloading the torrent job. If the torrent job is in seeding mode,
then this column displays the estimated time it will take for µTorrent
to reach <a href="AppendixA_04_04_01.html#Seeding_Goal">the seeding goal</a>.
If the torrent job is stopped or has reached its seeding goal, this
column will be blank. If the torrent job is transferring too slowly,
this column will display the <span class="value">∞</span> symbol. Note
that this column takes selective file downloading into account, so only
the data you select to be downloaded will be counted in the time
calculation.</li>
	<li><a class="name" id="Format" href="#Format">Format</a> displays the video quality of the torrent job, assuming it is a video and is an RSS item.</li><li><a class="name" id="Format" href="AppendixA_01_04.html#health">Health</a> displays 0-5 bars that indicate the availability of the torrent using:<span dir="ltr"> this formula - log2(<span style="font-style: italic;">Availability</span>).&nbsp; I.e. distributed
copies being 1 = 1 bar, 2 = 2 bars , </span><span dir="ltr">4 = 3 bars,&nbsp;8 = 4 bars and 16 = 5 bars.</span></li>
	<li><a class="name" id="Label" href="#Label">Label</a> displays the label set for the torrent job. <span class="mouse">Right-click</span>ing a torrent job on this column will bring up the <a href="#Context_Menu.Torrent_Options.Label">Label</a> context sub-menu.</li>
	<li><a class="name" id="Last_Active" href="#Last_Active">Last Active</a>
displays the amount of time that has elapsed since µTorrent last
finished transferring a chunk of data for the torrent job. When the
torrent job is downloading, this time will be reset only upon the
download completion of a piece. When the torrent job is seeding, this
time will be reset only upon the upload completion of a <span class="value">16</span>
KiB block of data. This number is updated only when the torrent job is
started. It should be understood that for stopped torrent jobs, the
number is relative to the time at which the torrent job was actually
stopped.</li>
	<li><a class="name" id="Peers" href="#Peers">Peers</a>
displays the number of peers you are connected to, and the number of
peers in the swarm within the parentheses. The number of peers in the
swarm is an estimate based on the maximum number of peers found either
between the amounts reported by any tracker, or the number of peers
µTorrent has encountered within its peer cache. If the torrent job is
stopped, and <a href="AppendixA_02_12.html#bt.scrape_stopped">bt.scrape_stopped</a> is enabled, µTorrent will show the maximum number of peers in the swarm as reported by the tracker scrapes.</li><li><a class="name" id="Peers" href="AppendixA_01_04.html#Playback">Playback</a>
- the multi-purpose stream/play/status button and display lets you
start streaming (of your&nbsp; choice of media file), play the stream
&nbsp;when ready and in between - shows the estimated time till this
stream is ready to play.</li>
	<li><a class="name" id="Ratio" href="#Ratio">Ratio</a> displays the ratio of uploaded data to downloaded data. Its value is calculated by dividing the number under the <a href="#Uploaded">Uploaded</a> column by the number under the <a href="#Downloaded">Downloaded</a>
column. If the torrent job was added when the file was already complete
(seeding the file upon adding), then the ratio will start from <span class="value">0</span>, and will be calculated based on the ratio of the uploaded data to the torrent content size.</li><li><a class="name" id="Ratio" href="AppendixA_01_04.html#Ratio">Rating</a> displays the average scores given by all users to this torrent</li>
	<li><a class="name" id="Remaining" href="#Remaining">Remaining</a>
displays the amount of data left for µTorrent to download before it
finishes downloading the torrent job. Note that this column takes
selective file downloading into account, so only the data you select to
be downloaded will be counted. If no data is left to be downloaded,
this column will be blank.</li>
	<li><a class="name" id="Seeds" href="#Seeds">Seeds</a>
displays the number of seeds you are connected to, and the number of
seeds in the swarm within the parentheses. The number of seeds in the
swarm is an estimate based on the maximum number of seeds found either
between the amounts reported by any tracker, or the number of seeds
µTorrent has encountered within its peer cache. If the torrent job is
stopped, and <a href="AppendixA_02_12.html#bt.scrape_stopped">bt.scrape_stopped</a> is enabled, µTorrent will show the maximum number of seeds in the swarm as reported by the tracker scrapes.</li>
	<li><a class="name" id="Seeds_Peers" href="#Seeds_Peers">Seeds/Peers</a> displays the ratio of seeds to peers. Its value is by dividing the number in the parentheses under the <a href="#Seeds">Seeds</a> column by the number in the parentheses under the <a href="#Peers">Peers</a> column.</li>
	<li><a class="name" id="Selected_Size" href="#Selected_Size">Selected Size</a>
shows only the size of the torrent contents you have selected for
µTorrent to download. The size of all pieces belonging to skipped files
that also pass the checks will also be taken into account and added in
this column.</li>
	<li><a class="name" id="Size" href="#Size">Size</a>
shows the complete size of the torrent contents, regardless of whether
you are using selective file downloading on that torrent job or not.</li>
	<li><a class="name" id="Source_URL" href="#Source_URL">Source URL</a> displays the URL that the source .torrent file is located at. The source URL is only applicable for RSS items and torrent jobs <a href="AppendixA_01_01.html#File.Add_Torrent_from_URL">added from URL</a>.</li>
	<li><a class="name" id="Status" href="#Status">Status</a>
displays the current status of the torrent job. If an error occurs on
this torrent job, depending on the error, it might be displayed on this
column. Otherwise, the following are normally displayed: <ul class="sublist">
			<li><a class="name" id="Status.Downloading" href="#Status.Downloading">Downloading</a> means the torrent job is currently downloading.</li>
			<li><a class="name" id="Status.Finished" href="#Status.Finished">Finished</a>
means the torrent job has been stopped after it reached seeding mode.
If the torrent job reaches this without user intervention, then it
means it reached <a href="AppendixA_04_04_01.html#Seeding_Goal">the seeding goal</a>.</li>
			<li><a class="name" id="Status.Initial_Seeding" href="#Status.Initial_Seeding">Initial-Seeding</a> means the torrent job is being seeded in Initial Seeding mode.</li>

</ul>

<h3><a class="name" id="Context_Menu" href="#Context_Menu">Context Menu</a></h3>
<p>If you <span class="mouse">right-click</span> on a torrent job, you'll see a context menu. They are described in the following list:</p>
<ul class="uienum">
	<li><a class="name" id="Context_Menu.Torrent_Options" href="#Context_Menu.Torrent_Options">Torrent Options</a>
		<ul class="sublist">
			<li><a class="name" id="Context_Menu.Torrent_Options.Open" href="AppendixA_01_04.html#Context_Menu.Torrent_Options.Transfer">Transfer</a> will copy your converted media file(s) to your selected paired device</li><li><a class="name" id="Context_Menu.Torrent_Options.Open" href="#Context_Menu.Torrent_Options.Open">Open</a>
will attempt to open the torrent contents for the selected torrent
job(s) with the associated application for the file type. This will
only work for single-file torrent jobs.</li>
			<li><a class="name" id="Context_Menu.Torrent_Options.Open_Containing_Folder" href="#Context_Menu.Torrent_Options.Open_Containing_Folder">Open Containing Folder</a>
opens the directory containing the torrent contents in an Explorer
window. If the torrent job contents consist of a single file, that file
will be highlighted. Otherwise, the torrent job's directory will be
displayed instead.</li><li><a class="name" id="Context_Menu.Torrent_Options.Open" href="AppendixA_01_04.html#Context_Menu.Torrent_Options.Show_Converted_Files">Show Converted Files</a> will open Windows Explorer in the location of the media files converted for your paired device</li>

			<li class="sep">&nbsp;</li>
			<li><a class="name" id="Context_Menu.Torrent_Options.Force_Start" href="#Context_Menu.Torrent_Options.Force_Start">Force Start</a> takes the selected torrent job(s) out of queue order (makes it ignore <a href="AppendixA_02_08.html">queueing</a>)
and forces it to start immediately, even if the maximum number of
active torrent jobs and/or downloads has been reached. Forced torrent
jobs will not stop even if they reach the seeding goal. The <a href="AppendixA_02_09.html">scheduler</a> is unable to stop forced torrent jobs.</li>
			<li><a class="name" id="Context_Menu.Torrent_Options.Start" href="#Context_Menu.Torrent_Options.Start">Start</a>

			<li><a class="name" id="Context_Menu.Torrent_Options.Pause" href="#Context_Menu.Torrent_Options.Pause">Pause</a>
will pause the selected torrent job(s), but won't actually stop it.
This tells µTorrent to attempt to retain connections to peers without
having to re-establish them like starting stopped torrent jobs would
require. It is useful for when you need quick access to bandwidth.
Realize that while µTorrent won't drop the connections on its own
accord, the connection can still get dropped by the client on the other
end of the connection.</li>
			<li><a class="name" id="Context_Menu.Torrent_Options.Stop" href="#Context_Menu.Torrent_Options.Stop">Stop</a> will stop the selected torrent job(s). All connections with peers are dropped.</li>

closer to the top of the queue (meaning it will become active sooner
than those with higher queue numbers). Holding <span class="key">Shift</span>
while pressing this button will move the selected torrent job to the
top of the queue. Note that this button will not visually move the
torrent job up the list unless you sort the list by the "#" column.
Pressing <span class="key">Ctrl</span>+<span class="key">Alt</span>+<span class="key">Up</span> on the keyboard is equivalent to selecting this item when the torrent job is selected.</li>
			<li><a class="name" id="Context_Menu.Torrent_Options.Move_Down_Queue" href="#Context_Menu.Torrent_Options.Move_Down_Queue">Move Down Queue</a>
will increase the selected torrent's queue number, thus bringing it

than those with lower queue numbers). Holding <span class="key">Shift</span>
while pressing this button will move the selected torrent job to the
bottom of the queue. Note that this button will not visually move the
torrent job down the list unless you sort the list by the "#" column.
Pressing <span class="key">Ctrl</span>+<span class="key">Alt</span>+<span class="key">Down</span> on the keyboard is equivalent to selecting this item when the torrent job is selected.</li>
			<li><a class="name" id="Context_Menu.Torrent_Options.Label" href="#Context_Menu.Torrent_Options.Labels">Labels</a>
allows you to set or reset labels for any selected torrent job. All

tells µTorrent to check the torrent contents of the selected torrent
job(s) for missing files and pieces that fail the hash check. Even if
multiple torrent jobs are selected to be re-checked, µTorrent will
check them sequentially, one at a time (known as a round-robin method).
Pausing a torrent job while it is being re-checked will pause the
re-checking process for that torrent job, and will move onto the next
torrent job to re-check if multiple torrent jobs are selected. Any
incomplete pieces in the torrent contents will be removed during the
re-checking process, so a drop in progress percentage would not be an
unlikely occurrence.</li>
